Usage

call function make_prediction over data and alreaady compiled model

# Example usage:
data_array = [
    1, 123456, 'Doe', 750, 'France',
    'Male', 35, 5, 5000, 2, 1,
    1, 60000
]
make_prediction(data_array, model)

AS A RESULT YOU WILL GET ONE OF THE OUTPUTS:

The model predicts that the customer will churn
The model predicts that the customer will not churn
